Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes, we can say they are variables that can be given a value.

Design tokens can be attributes such as: color, font, font size, spacing, border thickness, opacity, radius, shadow.

A good example of thinking about its application in the context of a project is to look at theme management, where we can have a color guide for light mode, or dark mode, or even themes for seasonal periods such as Black friday, Christmas, for example.

When we have pages in light mode, we use colors for fonts, colors for background, colors for buttons, colors for SVG illustrations other than dark mode, this is because we need to guarantee the contrast and good usability and accessibility of this product, be it a web or mobile.

And when we talk about a project with many pages, let's say in passing that without a well-elaborated design system, and with constant maintenance, it will be quite tiring to make changes and future updates with a certain speed.

Implementing design tokens in a project gives it scalability, allowing that by replacing the value of a few tokens, you have an entire project already re-purposed and ready for use, without much intervention from a developer.
